# Nginx Load Balancer Configuration

This repository contains the configuration files for setting up an Nginx load balancer to distribute traffic between multiple microservices. The configuration includes settings for logging and proxying requests to the backend services.

Project created as part of the Alura course on Nginx and microservices. The files have been recently edited to include proper logging configurations and proxy settings for the load balancer.
